        I love web development. I do. More than I ever thought I would. It turns
        out it's a lot more than centring divs. But every few time-units I find
        myself going through a sort of cleansing cycle:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>I start working on a personal project</li>
        <li>I build the web server back-end (probably in Go)</li>
        <li>
          I start working on the front-end using whatever's hip and happening at
          the time
        </li>
        <li>
          At some point, between the configuration files, compilers, state
          management etc. I get frustrated. "It shouldn't be this complicated"
        </li>
        <li>
          I throw it all in the bin and start smashing rocks until I have a page
          using only HTML and CSS; just like our forefathers intended
        </li>
        <li>This lasts until I need to do something fun on the page</li>
        <li>I start experimenting with server-side templating</li>
        <li>I start experimenting with minimal client-side JavaScript</li>
        <li>I conclude that I should probably use a JavaScript framework</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Then I get a bit depressed and unmotivated. Somewhere along the line, I
        lost sight of what I wanted to do in the first place, which was to build
        something. If I was a more goal-oriented person, I would probably be
        able to look past the tools and the processes and just do it, but I
        can't help myself from getting caught up in the details.
      </p>

      <h2>Where does it go wrong?</h2>
      <p>
        I think the part that trips me up is that, at its core, web pages seem
        deceptively simple. The browser receives text in a markup language and
        organises the content according to how you laid it out. You sprinkle in
        some CSS so that the browser makes things pretty, and maybe there are
        some events that fire when you interact with the rendered content, which
        the browser does via the JavaScript you've sent along. But it's all
        text, and very understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I get to the point where I'm busy setting up configuration files
        for a framework, running compilers and importing 12 libraries from said
        framework to do what feels like a trivial task, I start asking myself
        why it's necessary in the first place. I can't help but wonder if this
        is what assembly programmers felt like when compilers came about.
      </p>
      <h2>The process</h2>
      <h3>Starting from scratch</h3>
      <p>
        Getting the layout and feel for the page I'm building towards is
        straightforward. You can get a lot done with modern CSS, with animations
        and transitions making even simple interactions feel alive. Serving the
        page is also easy peasy. I write a small web server in Go, add a static
        route handler so I can serve the CSS file if I'm not doing in-line
        styling, add the "/" route, and return the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now if I were building a website that simply conveyed information, this
        would probably be enough (the Go server would actually be too much. Slap
        it on GitHub Pages or a Netlify instance and you're good to go). Sure
        there would be some code duplication in the layout of each page, but
        it's hardly a deal-breaker for something that is supposed to be largely
        static content (although I would probably regret it if I ever wanted to
        redesign the layout).
      </p>
      <h3>Getting fancy</h3>
      <p>
        At some point, I need to start adding some sort of functionality,
        usually in the form of a user signing in and displaying some profile
        information. The registering and sign-in process can still work
        perfectly fine up until this point, but displaying the user's info back
        to them causes a fork in the road.
      </p>
      <h4>To JavaScript, or not to JavaScript?</h4>
      <p>
        Since I'm still in caveman mode at this point, chances are that I'll
        take the back roads to avoid any chances of accidentally running into
        JavaScript and having my life ruined by its seductive lure. So that
        leaves HTML templating. I can't help but feel there is a certain
        hypocrisy to choosing templating instead of JavaScript since it feels
        like you're just swapping one dependency for another (at least from the
        mindset I'm in. If you want your website to function without JavaScript,
        you don't have much of a choice).
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll start by saying I'm not a huge fan of templating languages. I don't
        enjoy the fractured state in which it leaves the code. Importing CSS in
        the layout page that affects the User Profile 3 templates deep just
        doesn't sit right with me. Furthermore, taking something like the User
        Interface and coupling it to the back-end server's templating
        language/framework also feels wrong. It just feels like you should be
        able to cleanly separate them. It takes a bit more tinkering here for me
        to decide that, conceptually, I don't like templating.
      </p>
      <h4>To JavaScript</h4>
      <p>
        So this leaves me with JavaScript. But this time will be different. I'll
        write just a tiny bit of JavaScript, the absolute minimum necessary to
        add the functionality I want: display the user's profile information.
      </p>

      <p>
        And right off the bat, it's already complicated. You see, I don't have
        access to the user's profile information. It's still on the server, and
        since I have forsaken templates, the server is simply returning the
        static HTML I wrote beforehand.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I have to go fetch it from the server, which feels stupid because I
        was just there! Chances are that during the page load, I used the user
        credentials to fetch the user profile and validate that the user exists
        and can access the page, and now that the page is loaded I have to do it
        again! Why can't I just send a JSON response alongside the HTML
        response, which I can then access using the JavaScript on the page?
      </p>

      <p>
        So now I need to build another end-point that serves the user profile as
        a JSON response, I need to add API requests to the “super simple
        no-frills attached” JavaScript I swore I would write. If I'm feeling
        especially diligent I need to write tests for both the back-end serving
        the API, as well as the front-end consuming the API (or maybe just skip
        it altogether and just do an end-to-end test).
      </p>

      <p>
        And suddenly things start feeling complicated again. At this point, it
        is still palatable, but it takes a few more API requests and DOM
        manipulations to make me feel like it's becoming a mess.
      </p>

      <p>There must be a better way.</p>

      <div class="side-note">
        <div class="side-note-contents">
          <h3>Side note</h3>
          <p>
            <i
              >Why can't I just send a JSON response alongside the HTML
              response...</i
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            I have found a work-around for this, but it still requires a tiny
            amount of "server-side templating". You can add a script tag with an
            id to the HTML you're serving and populate it with a JSON object.
            Then, in your JavaScript, you can query for this tag and parse its
            contents as JSON. This way you're essentially sending a JSON
            response alongside your HTML response, and you don't have to do the
            round-trip back to the server.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Choose a JavaScript framework</h3>
      <p>
        Yep. I'm back here. And I have (again) realised <i>why</i> I'm here.
        And, usually, at this point, I'm just a bit tired and unmotivated, so I
        shelf the project (again) for another time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't have anything against JavaScript frameworks. I think most of
        them do a fantastic job. They all kind of achieve the same thing you've
        done a million times before, but in a slightly different way. Most
        importantly, they give structure to the development process. Recently
        I've been dabbling with <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> using
        <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> and I think it's
        fantastic. The way components are structured, seamlessly blending the
        scripting, HTML and styling, all in a way that makes everything reactive
        without having to think about hooks or callbacks is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>It just works <img src="./itjustworks.png" alt="Todd Howard" />.</p>

      <p>
        But in the back of my mind, I cannot shake this nagging feeling that
        something's still wrong. But I think that's part of the lure. It feels
        like a solvable problem, but no matter how many times I try, the
        solution stays just out of reach.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        If there's anything I would want you to take from this, it's that you
        should focus on your goal and not let superficial tools or processes get
        in the way. If, however, you are a lost cause such as myself, and you're
        unable to listen to good advice, then maybe you're interested in reading
        about how I'm attempting to use web components to do the same thing I've
        done a million times before, but in a slightly different way (coming
        soon&#8482;).
